# IM 시리즈

## IM탈출하자! 당신이 IM인 증거 5가지 | IM 시리즈 001
### Rule #1: Ava한테 질문하지 말기. 질문할 때는 수사학적 질문으로
`Oh, you wanna know about my place?`(X)  
`Oh, so you wanna know about my place... alright, well...`(O)

### Rule #2: 불편한 어려운 단어 쓰지 않기! 사용하기 편하고 자신감있는 간단한 단어 사용하기
`Basically, I live in a 4-storey house.`(X)  
`My home is really small.`(O)  
4-storey house는 4층짜리 집을 말함. house는 aparment와 반대되는 집의 의미가 강하므로 그냥 home이라고 할 것.

### Rule #3: 한 문장에서 같은 단어 반복하지 않기
`This place is a very small place.`(X)  
`My place is very small`(O)

### Rule #4: 묘사하거나 감정 단어를 2개 말할 때, "and" 사용하지 말기
`My room is comfy and cozy`(X)  
`My room is just so, you know, comfy. I mean, it's just so cozy!`(O)  
`just so` : 정확하게 한, 정말  
`just so you know` : 알고 있어, 참고로 알아둬.  

### Rule #5: 한가지에 대해서만 말하기!
자신의 집에 대해서 얘기하는데 근처의 대학에 대해 얘기하지 말 것
